## S.No 1: What is Ecmascript in JavaScript?
**Ans:** ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES) is the scripting language specification that JavaScript is based on. It defines the syntax, semantics, and standard library for JavaScript. Different versions of JavaScript, like ES5, ES6 (or ECMAScript 2015), ES2016, and so on, are implementations of the ECMAScript standard.

## S.No 2: What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var` in JavaScript?
**Ans:** `let`, `const`, and `var` are used for variable declaration in JavaScript.

- `var`: Function-scoped and can be redeclared within the same scope. Variables declared with `var` are hoisted.

- `let`: Block-scoped and can't be redeclared within the same block scope. It allows for block-level scoping, and variables declared with `let` are not hoisted.

- `const`: Block-scoped like `let`, but its value cannot be reassigned after declaration. However, for objects and arrays, the contents can be modified.

## S.No 3: What is the spread operator, rest operator, and default parameter in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- Spread Operator (`...`): Used to spread the elements of an array or the properties of an object. It's commonly used for array manipulation and object cloning.

- Rest Operator (`...` in function parameters): Used to collect multiple arguments into a single array parameter. It simplifies working with variable-length argument lists.

- Default Parameter: It allows you to provide default values for function parameters, so if a parameter is not passed or is `undefined`, the default value is used.

## S.No 4: What is deep copy and shallow copy in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- 1. Shallow Copy:
A shallow copy of an object creates a new object with a new reference to the top-level properties of the original object. However, it doesn't create copies of nested objects within the original object. Changes to nested objects in the copied object will affect the original object and vice versa. Here's an example:

```javascript
// Original object
const originalObject = {
  name: "John",
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    state: "NY"
  }
};

// Creating a shallow copy
const shallowCopy = Object.assign({}, originalObject);

shallowCopy.name = "Alice"; // Changes only the shallow copy
shallowCopy.address.city = "Los Angeles"; // Also changes the original object

console.log(originalObject); // { name: 'Alice', address: { city: 'Los Angeles', state: 'NY' } }
console.log(shallowCopy); // { name: 'Alice', address: { city: 'Los Angeles', state: 'NY' } }
```

- 2. Deep Copy:
A deep copy, on the other hand, creates a completely independent copy of an object, including all nested objects and their properties. Changes to the copied object won't affect the original object.

```javascript
// Original object
const originalObject = {
  name: "John",
  address: {
    city: "New York",
    state: "NY"
  }
};

// Creating a deep copy using JSON
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalObject));

deepCopy.name = "Alice"; // Changes only the deep copy
deepCopy.address.city = "Los Angeles"; // Does not affect the original object

console.log(originalObject); // { name: 'John', address: { city: 'New York', state: 'NY' } }
console.log(deepCopy); // { name: 'Alice', address: { city: 'Los Angeles', state: 'NY' } }
```

## S.No 5: What is a promise, callback function, and async/await in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- Promise: A Promise is an object used for asynchronous operations. It represents a value that might be available now or in the future, or it might fail. Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations and avoid callback hell.

- Callback Function: A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked when the other function completes. It's a common pattern for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

- Async/Await: Async and Await are used for writing asynchronous code that looks synchronous. The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, and `await` is used to pause the execution of the function until a Promise is resolved.

## S.No 6: What is the difference between a Promise and a callback in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
Promises and callbacks are both used to handle asynchronous operations, but they have differences:

- Promises provide a more structured way to handle asynchronous operations and can represent success and error states.

- Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when the operation is complete. Callbacks can lead to callback hell when dealing with nested asynchronous operations, making code less readable.

## S.No 7: What is event bubbling and event capturing in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
Event Bubbling and Event Capturing are two phases of event propagation in the DOM.

- **Event Bubbling:** In event bubbling, the innermost element's event is handled first, and the event bubbles up through its ancestors. It's the default behavior in most cases.

- **Event Capturing:** In event capturing, the outermost element's event is handled first, and the event trickles down to the target element. Event capturing is less common but can be used by specifying `true` as the third parameter when adding an event listener.

## S.No 8: What is a higher-order function in JavaScript?
**Ans:** A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments or returns a function as its result. Higher-order functions are a powerful concept in functional programming and enable functions to be more flexible and reusable.

## S.No 9: Explain different types of functions in JavaScript
**Ans:** In JavaScript, there are several types of functions:

- Regular Functions: These are the most common functions used for general code execution.

- Arrow Functions: Introduced in ES6, arrow functions are more concise and lexically scoped.

- Anonymous Functions: Functions without a name, often used as arguments to other functions.

- IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions): Functions that are defined and executed immediately after their creation.

- Recursive Functions: Functions that call themselves, often used for repetitive tasks or traversing data structures.

## S.No 10: What is an arrow function in JavaScript?
**Ans:** An arrow function is a concise way to define functions in JavaScript. It's introduced in ES6 and has a shorter syntax compared to regular functions. Arrow functions do not have their own `this` context and use the `this` of the enclosing context, making them useful for certain scenarios, such as in callbacks and anonymous functions.

## S.No 11: Why do we use `call`, `apply`, and `bind` methods in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- `call` and `apply` are used to change the value of `this` and invoke a function with a specified `this` context. They are often used when you want to borrow a method from another object or explicitly set the value of `this`.

- `bind` creates a new function with a specified `this` value but doesn't immediately invoke the function. It's useful when you want to preserve a specific `this` context for a function, and you can later invoke the bound function.

## S.No 12: How many ways are there to create objects in JavaScript?
**Ans:** There are several ways to create objects in JavaScript:

- Object Literal: `{}` creates an object with key-value pairs.

- Constructor Functions: You can create objects by defining constructor functions and using the `new` keyword.

- Object.create(): It creates a new object with the specified prototype object.

- Class: Introduced in ES6, you can use the `class` keyword to define and create objects in a more structured way.

- Object.assign(): It's used to copy the values of all enumerable properties from one or more source objects to a target object.

## S.No 13: What is prototype inheritance in JavaScript?
**Ans:** In JavaScript, prototype inheritance is a mechanism that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from a prototype object. Every object in JavaScript has a prototype, and when a property or method is accessed on an object, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain to find it if it doesn't exist directly on the object. This allows for code reuse and more efficient memory usage.

## S.No 14: What is TypeScript?
**Ans:** TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and additional features to the language. It is transpiled into plain JavaScript and offers benefits like better tooling support, enhanced code quality, and improved maintainability. TypeScript is often used for large-scale applications where type checking and code structure are crucial.

## S.No 15: What are the array methods and string methods in JavaScript?
**Ans:** Array methods are functions that can be applied to arrays for manipulation and transformation. Some common array methods include `push`, `pop`, `shift`, `unshift`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.

String methods are functions that can be applied to strings for text manipulation. Examples of string methods are `substring`, `split`, `concat`, `indexOf`, and `toUpperCase`.

## S.No 16: What is the difference between Java and JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- Java is a strongly typed, compiled programming language primarily used for building applications that run on servers, desktops, and embedded systems.

- JavaScript is a loosely typed, interpreted scripting language primarily used for web development to enhance the functionality of web pages and make them interactive.

The similarities in their names are mainly coincidental, and they are quite different in terms of syntax, usage, and execution environments.

## S.No 17: What is throttling and debouncing in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- Throttling is a technique to limit the rate at which a function is called. It ensures that the function is executed at a specified interval, preventing it from being called too frequently.

- Debouncing is a technique to ensure that a function is not called repeatedly in a short period. It waits for a pause in events before triggering the function, useful for handling actions like search suggestions or resizing events.

## S.No 18: What is `null` and `undefined` in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- `null` represents the intentional absence of any object value or a variable that doesn't have a value.

- `undefined` is a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It also represents the value returned from a function that doesn't explicitly return anything.

## S.No 19: What are falsy values in JavaScript?
**Ans:** Falsy values in JavaScript are values that are considered false when used in a boolean context. They include `false`, `0`, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, and an empty string `''`. Any other value is considered truthy.

## S.No 20: What is execution context, event loop, stack, call queue, and microtask queue in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- Execution Context: Execution context is an environment where JavaScript code is executed. It includes variables, functions, and the scope chain. Each function call creates a new execution context.

- Event Loop: The event loop is a fundamental part of JavaScript's concurrency model. It continuously checks the call stack and the task queue. It's responsible for managing asynchronous code execution.

- Stack: The call stack is a data structure that stores function calls. When a function is called, its call is pushed onto the stack, and when it's completed, it's popped off.

- Call Queue: The call queue, often referred to as the task queue, holds functions that are ready to be executed. It's used for managing asynchronous tasks.

- Microtask Queue: The microtask queue is used for managing microtasks, which have higher priority than regular tasks. Promises and `await` create microtasks.

## S.No 21: What is `setTimeout` and `setInterval` in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- `setTimeout`: `setTimeout` is a method in JavaScript used to execute a function or a code block after a specified amount of time. It's commonly used for delaying the execution of code.

- `setInterval`: `setInterval` is used to repeatedly execute a function or code at a specified time interval. It keeps executing the function until `clearInterval` is called or the program stops.

## S.No 22: What is `Object.seal` and `Object.freeze` in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- `Object.seal`: `Object.seal` is a method that seals an object, preventing new properties from being added and making existing properties non-configurable. However, you can still change the values of existing properties.

- `Object.freeze`: `Object.freeze` is a method that not only seals the object but also makes the properties non-writable. This means you cannot change the values of existing properties in a frozen object.

## S.No 23: What is the difference between `Map` and `Set` in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- `Map`: A `Map` is a collection of key-value pairs where the keys can be of any data type. It allows for efficient data retrieval based on keys and supports methods to manage and iterate over the data.

- `Set`: A `Set` is a collection of unique values. It doesn't allow duplicates, making it suitable for storing a list of distinct values. It provides methods for adding, deleting, and checking for the existence of values.

## S.No 24: What are `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- `WeakMap`: A `WeakMap` is a special type of map where keys are weakly referenced, which means they do not prevent the key objects from being garbage collected. This is useful for cases where you don't want to create memory leaks.

- `WeakSet`: A `WeakSet` is similar to a `Set` but only holds objects and allows for weak references. This is also used to avoid memory leaks in certain situations.

## S.No 25: What is `sessionStorage`, `localStorage`, and cookies in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- `sessionStorage` and `localStorage` are web storage mechanisms used to store data on the client-side. They have different lifespans: `sessionStorage` data is only available during the session, while `localStorage` data persists even after the session ends.

- Cookies are small pieces of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer. They are primarily used for maintaining user-specific information, such as login status and user preferences.

## S.No 26: Write a program to sort an array.
**Ans:** Here's a simple example of sorting an array in ascending order using the `Array.prototype.sort` method:

```javascript
const numbers = [4, 2, 8, 1, 6];
numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(numbers); // Output: [1, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

## S.No 27: What is the use of `JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse()` methods in JavaScript?
**Ans:** `JSON.stringify` is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string, while `JSON.parse()` is used to parse a JSON string and convert it into a JavaScript object. These methods are commonly used for data exchange between the client and server or for storing data in a structured format.

## S.No 28: What are `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` in JavaScript?
**Ans:** 
- `map`: The `map` function is used to create a new array by applying a given function to each element of the original array. It returns a new array of the same length.

- `filter`: The `filter` function is used to create a new array with all elements that pass a given test (provided as a function). It returns a new array containing only the elements that satisfy the condition.

- `reduce`: The `reduce` function is used to apply a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.

## S.No 29: What is a generator function in JavaScript?
**Ans:** A generator function is a special type of function in JavaScript that allows you to pause and resume its execution. It's defined using an asterisk (`function*`) and uses the `yield` keyword to yield control back to the caller temporarily. Generator functions are often used for creating iterators and for asynchronous code.

## S.No 30: How to stop event propagation in JavaScript?
**Ans:** To stop event propagation in JavaScript, you can use the `stopPropagation()` method. It prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree during the capturing or bubbling phase. For example:

```javascript
element.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  event.stopPropagation(); // Stops the click event from further propagation
});
```

## S.No 31: What is closure in JavaScript?
**Ans:** A closure is a function that "closes over" the variables from its outer function, even after that outer function has finished executing. This allows the inner function to retain access to the outer function's variables, making it useful for encapsulation and data privacy.

## S.No 32: What is hoisting in JavaScript?
**Ans:** Hoisting is a behavior in JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during compilation. This means you can use variables and functions before they are declared in the code. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

## S.No 33: What is the dead zone in JavaScript?
**Ans:** The dead zone in JavaScript refers to the period between the creation (declaration) and the initialization (assignment) of a variable declared with `let` or `const`. During the dead zone, attempting to access the variable will result in a `ReferenceError`. This concept ensures that variables are not accessed before they are initialized.

## S.No 34: What is function currying in JavaScript?
**Ans:** Function currying is a technique in which a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a sequence of functions, each taking one argument. This allows you to create reusable and more specialized functions, particularly in functional programming. Curried functions are often created using closures.

## S.No 35: What is mutation observer in JavaScript?
**Ans:** A MutationObserver is a JavaScript object that watches for changes in the DOM and triggers a callback function when mutations occur. It's used to observe and react to changes in the structure or attributes of the DOM, such as when elements are added, removed, or modified.

## S.No 36: What is memoization in JavaScript?
**Ans:** Memoization is an optimization technique in JavaScript where the results of expensive function calls are cached to avoid redundant computations. This is particularly useful for functions that take a long time to compute the same result for the same inputs.
## S.No 37 What is the output of the below console
**Ans:**
```javascript
//Q .1:
(function() {
    var a = b = 3;
})();
console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined'));
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined'));
//Output:
// a defined? false
// b defined? true

//Q .2:
console.log(0.1 + 0.2);
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3);

        console.log(3)
    }, 0);
    console.log(4);
})();
//Output:
// 1
// 4
// 3
// 2

//Q .4:
console.log(1 + "2" + "2");
console.log(1 + +"2" + "2");
console.log(1 + -"1" + "2");
console.log(+"1" + "1" + "2");
console.log("A" - "B" + "2");
console.log("A" - "B" + 2);
// Output
//122
// 32
// 02
// 112
// NaN2
// NaN

//Q .5:
var a = {},
    b = {
        key: 'b'
    },
    c = {
        key: 'c'
    };
a[b] = 123;
a[c] = 456;
console.log(a[b]);
// Output
// 456

//Q .6:
(function(x) {
    return (function(y) {
        console.log(x);
    })(2)
})(1);
// Output
// 1

```
